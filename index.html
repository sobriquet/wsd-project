        <h1><center>Who Is She ... Really ?</center></h1>
        
        <p>People ask me that alot, before they get to really know me. They say I have a quiet intimidation about me. I'm all of 5'2", I doubt that 
        I can be the slightest intimidating in anyway, shape or form. Initially most person perceive me as shy and reserved, but I'm usually observing my surroundings when I'm in unfamilair places with unfamiliar faces. Watching  
        people and their day to day shananigans fascinates me. Besides that my mind stays in overdrive. Some say I'm like a Jane of all Trades and because of 
        the inability for most to describe me in one word, or classify me as any one particular thing or associate me 
        with any one specific title I've adapted the moniker, <strong>Tejizlyke</strong> (Tej Is Like). There are a few things I've done consistently over the last couple of years.

   <article>
        <p><strong>Managing Editor</strong>
        
        For an online magazine, G Style. We focus primarily on fashionable technology. Just a group of geeks, 
        gamers and gadget junkies talking about the things we love the most.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Glacierz Girlz</strong>, I am co-owner of a 360 Entertainment Company. Glacierz is also the name of our main artist currently signed to a major label.
        We've proven that although it can be difficult for friends to be business partners it's much better to do business with people you trust.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Dancing</strong>I've been dancing since I was 3 years old. Ballet, tap, modern, hip hop basically anything I can move my feet to. That has progressed into a
        very interesting choreography career. </p>
         
        <p><strong>Computers</strong>, at work they call me IT - any and everything to do with a computer, applications, software and even apps on their phones
        everyone seems to come to me. I've always had a love for all things technology and very happily identify myself as a Geek, Nerd, unCOOL; etc.
