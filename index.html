        <h1>Anything You Can Do ...</h1>
        
        <p> <p>I can do better. Not in spite of being a girl, but dare I say because I am a girl ? Most men I know think a girl
        of at least average looks with more than 10 popular people in their personal cellphones (not counting the ones she may have hacked ;) 
        cannot possibly be that smart, tech loving and computer knowledgeable. I am by every definition a <strong>Geek</strong> and I am proud.</p>

        <h1><strong>People Say Geeks Are</strong></h1>
        <div></div>
  <ul>
     <li>Peculiar or otherwise dislikable people</li>
     <li>Boring and unattractive social misfits</li>
     <li>Oddballs</li>
   </ul>

     <h2>A Geek to Me Is:</h2> 
  <ul>
     <li>A person with a devotion to something in a way that places him or her outside the mainstream.</li>
     <li>A person who is interested in technology, especially computing and new media.</li>
     <li>One who passionately pursues skill (especially technical skill) and imagination, not mainstream social acceptance.</li>
  </ul>

        <p><strong>Glacierz Girlz</strong>, I am co-owner of a 360 Entertainment Company. Glacierz is also the name of our main artist currently signed to a major label.
        Not all GEEKS are on trick ponies.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Dancing</strong> I've been dancing since I was 3 years old. Ballet, tap, modern, hip hop basically anything I can move my feet to. And they say GEEKS have 2 left feet.</p>
         
        <p><strong>Computers</strong>, at work they call me Miss IT - any and everything to do with a computer, applications, software and even apps on their phones
        everyone seems to come to me. I've always had a love for all things technology and very happily identify myself as a Geek, Nerd, unCOOL; etc.
